        <h3>I argue that outdoor activities is much better than Indoor activities.</h3>
        <p>
            People often ask, "what do you prefer to stay home with some electronic devices like smartphones, laptops, and TV or to spend time outdoor?"<br>
            It is one of the debated questions these days since the way people spend their time is different compared to the past.<br>
            People used to spend time doing outside activities such as hiking, biking, and meeting friends in the past.<br>
            However, these days, many people prefer to do indoor activities. Due to technology development,<br>
            they can use electronic devices to do many things like playing online games, watching movies, and surfing the internet.<br>
            However, these changes make people have limited enjoyment of their interests and ruin their health.<br>
            <b>Therefore, I claim that doing outdoor activities is much better than enjoying indoor activities.</b>

        <h3>What are the advantages of outdoor activities?</h3>
        <h4>People can be happier</h4>
        <p>
            As many people already know, doing outdoor activities is suitable for people's physical health.<br>
            However, also doing outdoor activities can help with their mental health.<br>
            Spending time, especially in nature, can improve people's mood and get rid of their stress and depression.<br>
            <i>Imagine that you are at the park.</i><br>
            They definitely provide you with a place to relax.<br>
            You can also unwind and recharge while relaxing.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>It gives you an opportunity to make a friend.</h4>
        <p>
            By spending time outdoor with others, people can experience the social benefits of outdoor activities.<br>
            For example, people can meet and build relationships with others when they participate in sports that they can enjoy with various people.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these reasons, I argue that it is much better to spend time outdoors.
