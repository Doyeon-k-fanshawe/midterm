        <h3>I argue that indoor activities is much better than outdoor activities.</h3>
        <p>
            eveybody says that they should go out and do stuff but what i believe is children<br>
            people should spend more time on gadegts being inside the house and go according to the current treding things in world that<br>
            internet as without internet there is nothing and everything<br> is available being inside at home so with the internet they can take such advantages.

        <h3>What are the advantages of indoor activities?</h3>
        <h4>People don't need to waste energy and go out</h4>
        <p>
            As many people already know, doing indoor activities is easy.<br>
            doing indoor activites with the help of internet you can also stay updated with what's going on around the world .<br>
            You can take rest whenever you want to and there will be no chances of getting caught with diseases like covid in this tough time.<br>
            you can even earn money by working from home.
        </p>
        <h4>It gives you an opportunity to make a friend virtually as well.</h4>
        <p>
            by staying indoor you can protect yourself from diseases like COVID. moreover, by staying indoor you can accsess to multiple things at a time too
        </p>
        <p>
            For these reasons, I argue that it is much better to spend time indoor.
